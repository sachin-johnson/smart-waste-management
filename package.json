  "description": "In Australia, kerbside bin collection is managed by local councils, and proper waste sorting is critical to reducing contamination. This project aims to develop an intelligent system that uses a camera and motion detection to monitor and analyze waste disposal in kerbside bins (organic, recyclable, and general waste bins). The system automatically detects when waste is placed in a bin, identifies the type of waste, and determines if it is correctly sorted. Privacy concerns are addressed by blurring the surroundings in the recorded video.",
